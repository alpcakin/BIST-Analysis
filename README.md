# BIST 100: USD and Inflation-Adjusted Analysis

The Turkish stock market (BIST 100) shows impressive gains in Turkish Lira terms, but this can be misleading. This project analyzes BIST 100's real performance from three perspectives:

1. **TRY Terms** - Nominal returns
2. **USD Terms** - Currency-adjusted returns
3. **Real USD Terms** - Both currency and US inflation-adjusted returns

## Motivation

As Turkish investors, when we say "we made money in stocks," how much did our purchasing power actually increase? This analysis answers that question.

## Data Sources

- BIST 100: Yahoo Finance (`XU100.IS`)
- USD/TRY: Yahoo Finance (`USDTRY=X`)
- US CPI: FRED API
